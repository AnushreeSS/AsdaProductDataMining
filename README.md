# Asda Product Data Mining
This project consists of a basic crawler and scraper built using Selenium. 

The crawler and scraper can be used on URLs from the ASDA groceries website. Alternatively, the URLs can be taken from the sitemaps below:
 - Catelogue URLs (to be used with crawler) : https://groceries.asda.com/sitemap-category.xml
 - Product URLs (to be used with scraper) : https://groceries.asda.com/sitemap-products.xml 

Although this project has been implemented for ASDA groceries, the code can be extended to other similar websites by changing the class or ID tags.
